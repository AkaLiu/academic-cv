  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications. CNNs contain millions of parameters, and a large number of computations challenge hardware design. In this paper, we take advantage of the output activation sparsity of CNNs to reduce the execution time and energy consumption of the network. We propose Low Rank Prediction (LRP), an effective prediction method that leverages the output activation sparsity. LRP first predicts the output activation polarity of the convolutional layer based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) approach of the convolution kernel. And then it uses the predicted negative value to skip invalid computation in the original convolution. In addition, an effective accelerator, LRPPU, is proposed to take advantage of sparsity to achieve network inference acceleration. Experiments show that our LRPPU achieves 1.48 x speedup and 2.02 x energy reduction compared with dense networks with slight loss of accuracy. Also, it achieves on average 2.57 x speedup over Eyeriss and has similar performance and less accuracy loss compared with SnaPFA.},

  abstract = {To accelerate time-consuming multi-objective design space exploration of CPU, previous work trains prediction models using a set of performance metrics derived from few simulations, then predicts the rest. Unfortunately, the low accuracy of models limits the exploration effect, and how to achieve a good trade-off between multiple objectives is challenging.In this paper, we investigate various prediction models and find out the most accurate basic model. We enhance the model by ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy. A hypervolume-improvement-based optimization method to trade off between multiple objectives is proposed together with a uniformity-aware selection algorithm to jump out of the local optimum. Experiments demonstrate that our open-source framework can reduce the distance to the Pareto optimal set by 76\% and prediction error by 97\% compared with the state-of-the-art work.},
