Welcome! This is Jamie S. Benson's home on the web. I'm a population health & trauma systems researcher with a passion for health equity and social justice. Currently, I am applying to Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs) to work towards my goal of becoming a physician-scientist! It's Wintertime in Vermont, so I'm also out skiing, snowshoeing, and photographing the Green Mountains.

You can find my publications on the "Publications" tab, my abstracts, posters, and podium presentations on the "Presentations" tab, and my current CV on the "CV" tab.

If you've got a question, want access to a paper, or want to collaborate on a project, reach out! You can find my contact information on the lefthand panel.
