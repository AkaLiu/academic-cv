Welcome! My name is Jamie Benson. I’m a current MD/PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine with a passion for health equity and social justice. My research sits at the intersections of epidemiology, trauma systems analysis, and health services research. As a member of the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), I am pursuing an MD, as well as a PhD in Epidemiology.

I graduated from the University of Vermont in 2020 with an individually designed bachelors in Healthcare Structure & EMS Research, as well as a minor in biochemistry. I previously worked as a prehospital care provider (Advanced EMT) for eight years, and had the pleasure of collaborating with the Vermont Department of Health on evidence-based revisions of statewide EMS protocols. I also have extensive experience in information technology, having run an IT consulting business for ten years, focusing on end user and small-medium business support, web development, device repair, and business process optimization.

You can find my publications on the “Publications” tab, my abstracts, posters, and podium presentations on the “Presentations” tab, and my current CV on the “CV” tab.
