Welcome! My name is Jamie Benson. I’m a population health & trauma systems researcher at the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine with a passion for health equity and social justice. My research sits at the intersections of epidemiology, trauma systems analysis, and health services research.

I graduated from the University of Vermont in 2020 with an individually designed bachelors in Healthcare Structure & EMS Research, as well as a minor in biochemistry. I have been working as a prehospital care provider (Advanced EMT) for seven years, and have had the pleasure of collaborating with the Vermont Department of Health on evidence-based revisions of our statewide EMS protocols. I also have extensive experience in information technology, having run an IT consulting business for ten years, focusing on end user support, small business networking, web development, and business process optimization.

Currently, I am applying to Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs) to work towards my goal of becoming a physician-scientist! It’s Wintertime in Vermont, so I’m also out skiing, snowshoeing, and photographing the Green Mountains.

You can find my publications on the “Publications” tab, my abstracts, posters, and podium presentations on the “Presentations” tab, and my current CV on the “CV” tab.

If you’ve got a question, want access to a paper, or want to collaborate on a project, reach out! You can find my contact information on the lefthand panel.
